> **What is Data Structure?**
- Datastructures are the building blocks or raw materials of a software programs.
- A data structure is a particular way of storing and organizing data in our devices to use the data efficiently and effectively. The main idea behind using data structures is to minimize the time and space complexities. An efficient data structure takes minimum memory space and requires minimum time to execute the data. 

> **What is Algorithm?**
- A set of finite rules or instructions to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations 
- Algorithm means a process or set of well-defined instructions that are typically used to solve a particular group of problems or perform a specific type of calculation. To explain in simpler terms, it is a set of operations performed in a step-by-step manner to execute a task. 


You're absolutely right! Data structures and algorithms go hand-in-hand, so the roadmap should integrate both together in a step-by-step manner. Here's an updated roadmap where we introduce algorithms alongside data structures as required:
